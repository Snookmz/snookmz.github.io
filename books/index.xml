      <description>Effortless Greg Mckeown summary  Highlights    Keep it simple stupid - perfection is the enemy of good.   Take the first step - create a MVP (minimum viable product).   Clear your head - remove negative emotions, they make it harder to concentrate.   Be present, be positive - remove distractions from other tasks and negative thoughts.   Make it enjoyable, don&#39;t over exert - don&#39;t endure the task, turn it into an enjoyable challenge to overcome.</description>

      <description>There’s an upper limit to how much time and effort we can invest. And the more depleted we get, the more our return on that effort dwindles. The lesson is similar to the one I’d always ascribed to: if you prioritize the most important things first, then there will be room in your life not only for what matters most but also for other things too. But do the reverse, and you’ll get the trivial things done but run out of space for the things that really matter.</description>

      <description>The Psychology of Money Timeless lessons on wealth, greed and happiness My Impressions
You are not so Smart  No one can accurately predict the market. No one can see it happen, only explain it away after it has happened. The economy is not like engineering, physics is guided by laws that we understand and can measure, the economy is guided by people and behaviours which is much harder to predict.</description>

      <description>One Up on Wall Street Summary Balance Sheets  Cash flow is a good indicator of company&amp;rsquo;s prosperity. An increasing cash flow from year to year is an indicator of an improving company. Long-term debt reduction is another sign of prosperity. Compare long-term debt over the years and if it is reducing, that&amp;rsquo;s a good sign. Cash exceeding debt it is very favourable. A company cannot go bankrupt if it has more cash than debt.</description>

      <description>Excerpts
By consolidating his work into intense and uninterrupted pulses, he’s leveraging the following law of productivity: High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)
By maximizing his intensity when he works, he maximizes the results he produces per unit of time spent working.
The very best students often studied less than the group of students right below them on the GPA rankings. One of the explanations for this phenomenon turned out to be the formula detailed earlier: The best students understood the role intensity plays in productivity and therefore went out of their way to maximize their concentration—radically</description>

      <description>Deep Work Review Deep work can be summed up into an oversimplified equation:
High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) * (Intensity of Focus) My Main take-aways Task switching is the enemy of deep work  This includes pop-up notifications, over-heard conversations, briefly checking emails. Task switching leaves task residue. Switch from task A to task B and there will be some residue of task A in your brain occupying space and reducing the depth of your work.</description>
