<ul>
<li>
<p>Volatility does not measure risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beta is a measure of volatility, it is wrong as a measure of risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Past volatility does not determine the risk of investing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He gives the example of a farm that was welling for $2000 an acre. A few years later due to various economic factors the price dropped to $600 an acre. According to Beta a purchase of the property at $600 is riskier than buying that same property years earlier at $2000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buffett state that risk comes from the types of business you&rsquo;re in, some businesses are riskier than others. Me: The price the market values a business has no bearing on the riskiness of the business itself, only the share price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk comes from not understanding the business you&rsquo;re buying into, not knowing what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charlie Munger states that 50% of the stuff tought in finance schools is twaddle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You&rsquo;re not right because 1000 people agree with you, or disagree with you. You are right because your facts are right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charlie Munger inverts. When Munger was a weather forcaster during the war, he would forcast weather for pilots. He inverted the question, he asked &lsquo;how can I kill these pilots?&rsquo; He thought it through that way so he could avoid it. The answer was &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get him flying into ice, or I&rsquo;ll get him to run out of fuel&rsquo;.</p>
