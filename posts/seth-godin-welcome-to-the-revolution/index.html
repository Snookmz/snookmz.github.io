      <ul>
<li>We are living through a revolution because of the pandemic.</li>
<li>Revolutions destroy the &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; and enable the impossible. We are all living virtually now.</li>
<li>&lsquo;Perfect&rsquo; - means you play the game and you&rsquo;re winning well enough to play the game. Telegraph was perfect before the telephone. People dealing with perfect usually say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to the new technology. Yahoo had a chance to buy Google for 10 mil.</li>
<li>Management is not the same as leadership. Management is making things a little big better, cheaper in a reliable way.</li>
<li>Leadership is voluntary, you can choose to lead or choose to follow. Leadership is voluntarily signing up to change the game. Leadership &lsquo;might not work&rsquo;. If you&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s going to work then it is management.</li>
<li>Leadership is exploring the edges, finding problems and solving them.</li>
<li>Resistance is our fear of being wrong, our fear of change.</li>
<li>Leaders want to change the game.</li>
<li>On a good day, what happened because you went to work? If you are watching this, you are in a position which has leverage.</li>
<li>A good day is a day you make change happen. Who are you seeking to change?</li>
<li>Are you &lsquo;enrolled&rsquo; in the journey.</li>
<li>Most people who do Udemy courses do not finish them. There&rsquo;s no prize to finish - they feel good because they paid the money to watch the videos.</li>
<li>&lsquo;Enrolled&rsquo; so frustrated with lack of forward motion that it&rsquo;s as if you&rsquo;re not being paid on time.</li>
<li>Gradual changes and shifts in the culture end up leading to the long term transformation that we seek.</li>
<li>Where is the authority, who will let me do this? This is not leadership. We are afraid of responsibility. Authority is hard to find, responsibility is easy to get.</li>
<li>Decide you want to change the game. Choose your project and that will change your future.</li>
<li>Choose your project choose your future. Seth missed the Internet, he thought it wouldn&rsquo;t work.</li>
<li>Jugglers are good at catching the ball.</li>
<li>Juggling has nothing to do with catching, it has to do with throwing. Get good at throwing.</li>
<li>Get comfortable with the ball dropping to the ground, then you&rsquo;ll get good at throwing.</li>
<li>Most people spend all the time getting good at trying to catch.</li>
<li>Relentless curiosity.</li>
<li>Agility doesn&rsquo;t mean you always land. When you&rsquo;re wrong you&rsquo;re still in the game.</li>
<li>Do work that matters for people who care.</li>
<li>People often know the solution to the problem, they just don&rsquo;t like the cost.</li>
<li>Your boss won&rsquo;t let you do something big and new because if you succeed you&rsquo;ll take responsibility and if you fail your boss takes the blame.
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t ask for permission, just make small changes to improve things and if it fails take the blame and if it succeeds give away responsibility</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Discover what works and what doesn&rsquo;t. It requires us to take responsibility. Do small beneficial and brave acts.</li>
<li>If you chose your projects you chose your future. How can I choose?</li>
</ul>
