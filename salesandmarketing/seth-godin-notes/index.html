<ul>
<li>Marketing is &lsquo;Work that matters for people who care&rsquo; not spamming.</li>
<li>What do we make? We are trying to make a change happen.
<ul>
<li>Does that mean better? Better is always in the eyes in the customer.</li>
<li>Enemy of better is average.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t yell at everyone about your average product.</li>
<li>Minimum viable audience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make something better for people who need something better.</li>
<li>Seek minimum viable audience, the smallest audience you can live with.</li>
<li>Water kiosk in India will only sell fresh water to people with blue buckets - they say it&rsquo;s for health but really it makes everyone carry a blue bucket which then advertises their water.
<ul>
<li>The water kiosk brought around microscopes at schools to show that the water they normally drink is full of bacteria.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Status roles - all that WWE wrestling is about. Same is true of politics, business.
<ul>
<li>Threats to status - what will happen if I don&rsquo;t get this tool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Direct marketing is measured. Spend 100, get 200 back.
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t measure things that don&rsquo;t matter - Twitter followers don&rsquo;t matter, it has nothing to do with value of brand. Measure ad click throughs, they matter.</li>
<li>Brand is trust - not just a logo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Super bowl ads, people pay a premium to reach the average people.
<ul>
<li>Ads cannot easily measure results from these ads. They only get poor measures which gives them false or misleading information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New ideas to the market - about 1/6 people buy it because it&rsquo;s new. Early adopters.
<ul>
<li>This doesn&rsquo;t mean the uptake will go up forever. There&rsquo;s a difference between those who buy things because it&rsquo;s new, and those who buy things because it works.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Positioning as a service.
<ul>
<li>People cannot possibly remember every attribute of what you make.</li>
<li>Position yourself away from everybody else.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mandatory education almost never works.
<ul>
<li>You learn when you&rsquo;re engaged in the journey (knowing about your favourite hockey player).</li>
<li>Earn enrolment.</li>
<li>I see you as the kind of person who would like to come on this journey with me. Make people want to go on this journey with you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your product is not going to spread because you want it to. It will spread because the people that you serve want it to.
<ul>
<li>Users will tell others.</li>
<li><strong>Build it to share, it is way more likley that it&rsquo;ll be shared.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Heath - add sharing functionality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More isn&rsquo;t the point, better is the point.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="question-time">Question time:</h4>
<ul>
<li>If the wrong kid brings in a yo-yo, then it doesn&rsquo;t take off. If the right kid brings in a yo-yo every other kid wants a yo-yo.</li>
<li>Google vs Bing. People preferred Google, but they did swapped the logos and people still preferred Google even though it was actually Bing.</li>
<li>Seth was on a plane which had an emergency landing. The plane had to stay at that airport which was 30 minutes drive from the proper destination for 3 hours. He booked a car and then stood up and asked if anyone wanted a ride. No one took up his offer. He thinks if he had stood up and handed out cards and said &lsquo;anyone who gets a queen gets to come with me in the car&rsquo;, he creates scarcity and probably gets people to come with him.</li>
<li>Survey - people who answer surveys who have a chip on their shoulder or nothing better to do. They don&rsquo;t give good information. Call customers directly instead, or speak to them when you have the opportunity.
<ul>
<li>Sony had a bunch of people test out a radio. They all said they liked it and were asked how much they should sell it for. People said &lsquo;50-100 dollars&rsquo;. As they finished they were offered $20 or a free radio, they all took the $20. So they didn&rsquo;t really think the radio was worth that much money, they lied. Their behaviour is more interesting than the information they gave.</li>
<li>1 star reviews are not helpful. 1 star reviews mean &lsquo;this isn&rsquo;t for me&rsquo;. More noise than information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Creating tension is really easy, just be silent. Create tension online with scarcity and fear of loss.
<ul>
<li>You can&rsquo;t beat amazon, don&rsquo;t even try.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Psychographics are how you act, what you want, what you believe. Psychographics are worth 100x more than demographics (your age, sex, location).
<ul>
<li>Pay extra for the psychographics you seak.</li>
<li>Pay more for the specific people who will buy your product.</li>
<li>Opinions don&rsquo;t matter, test your results.</li>
<li>If you A/B test enough, you will build a porn site. Numbers of clicks are not always the best measure as you can attract the wrong people.</li>
<li>If you sell SEO, you either have to convince people who already use SEO to come and use your product, or convince people who don&rsquo;t use SEO that they need SEO.</li>
<li>First is over-rated when it comes to bringing an idea to the table, relevant, generous and persistent matter way more.</li>
<li>AirBNB said no to business people and people looking for bargains to begin with. The tailored for a specific segment of the market. The built something of destinction. There&rsquo;s a certain psychographic that they target - delight them, then they tell their friends.</li>
<li>Beer. The number one selling beer in the US is &lsquo;other&rsquo;. So the long tail of beer brands outsells the big players. That&rsquo;s why it pays to stand for something.</li>
<li>Facebook and LinkdIn grew so fast because it works better if your friends are using it. So people shared it. That&rsquo;s why there are fax machines, so tell everyone you know so you can send faxes to them. SAAS - certain varieties are better if other people are using it (like Slack).
<ul>
<li>If you have a price of software that will give your business a competetitive advantage that will go away if your competitors get it too, you won&rsquo;t talk about it. Software like that doesn&rsquo;t grow well. To make that kind of software work you need to pick one player per industry and charge a huge premium. e.g. Nutrasweet had a patented sweeterner, instead of going to everyone and selling it, they contacted Coke and Pepsi and offered an exclusive deal and let them bid against each other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Redbull became huge overnight because they paid bar tenders to sell vodka and redbull to high status customers in a public way. They sponsered sports events that had no sponsers, so they were seen as early adopters.</li>
<li>If you take your ad and a competitors ad and swap the logos. If you can&rsquo;t tell the difference then you haven&rsquo;t done anything good. Feels safe but doesn&rsquo;t get you where you want to go. Write ads that some people won&rsquo;t like that are memorable.</li>
<li></li>
