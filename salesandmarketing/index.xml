      <description>UK&#39;s most hated sales trainer  How to get out of voicemail purgatory   Benjamin Dennehy is the UK&#39;s most hated sales trainer. I came first across this guy on the Mike Winnet podcast / YouTube channel (who indecently puts out the funniest take-downs of online &#39;success&#39; scammers). He is a very down-to-earth sales trainer with a unique perspective on how to be the best salesperson you can.</description>

      <description>We are living through a revolution because of the pandemic. Revolutions destroy the &amp;lsquo;perfect&amp;rsquo; and enable the impossible. We are all living virtually now. &amp;lsquo;Perfect&amp;rsquo; - means you play the game and you&amp;rsquo;re winning well enough to play the game. Telegraph was perfect before the telephone. People dealing with perfect usually say &amp;lsquo;no&amp;rsquo; to the new technology. Yahoo had a chance to buy Google for 10 mil. Management is not the same as leadership.</description>

      <description>Problem in the US used to be over-production from factories.  We needed to find out how to get people to buy lots of stuff. We needed people to be cogs in the system to work for these factories. Public schools were invented to [in part] to fix this. If you fit in, you can become a part of this giant machine.   Art is the opposite of being a compliant cog.</description>

      <description>Marketing Masterclass  Marketing is &amp;lsquo;Work that matters for people who care&amp;rsquo; not spamming. What do we make? We are trying to make a change happen.  Does that mean better? Better is always in the eyes in the customer. Enemy of better is average. Don&amp;rsquo;t yell at everyone about your average product. Minimum viable audience.   Make something better for people who need something better. Seek minimum viable audience, the smallest audience you can live with.</description>
